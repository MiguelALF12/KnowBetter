Simple application that read and explain some sort of texts; it was made using python and QT design.

The text are programming excercises that are divided into specific steps. This is usefull to everyone who is starting to learn programming fundamentals.

## Some notes
In order to use the app you will need to:
  - Clone the repository or download the zip
  - Open up your terminal or IDE of preference (in case you want to detail the code)
  - Type `python3 main.py`
  - To get some excercises, open the `Lista de ejercicios.docx` located in `BACKEND/Others/` module
  - Copya one excercise and paste it on the executed window field

## Adding more excercises
In the `Lista de ejercicios.docx` you will see more excercises ini case you want those to be analyzed. In order to do so you will need to edit `excercises.csv` located in `BACKEND/` module. You must follow the headers of each row as follows:
  - empieza -> Problem to be analized, it must be without numbers. 
  - tipo -> short description of the problem
  - tema -> it coould be `hacer`, `condicion-info`, `entrada`, `salida`, `pseudocodigo`
